# Feed Forward Neural Network --- classify points

Exercise from: https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera (solution to the Coursera class on Neural Networks and Deep Learning)

The first exercise is (inspired) from:
https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer.ipynb


The problem is to learn a classifier for two different class of points on the 2d plane.

We will use the mlpack library for this (http://www.mlpack.org/docs/mlpack-3.0.2/doxygen/anntutorial.html).


The exercise will show you:

1. How to set up a feed forward neural network (with just one layer)
2. How to initialize the model parameters
3. How to train the network
4. How to run the network for classification


Set up a feed forward network with one hidden layer, train it, and run it for classification using mlpack.
